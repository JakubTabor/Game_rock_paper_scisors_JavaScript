# I gonna use objects to create the score in my rock paper scissors
* An object is a group of multiply values together
* We create object like that (const product = {}) and inside we pass properties and assign values to them
* Next we can acces these values calling properties inside console
* console.log(product.name) product - object, name - property

# An object is just another type of value, we can save it inside a variable or display
* We use object to group related values together or to use multiply values together
* log is a functions that is stored inside console object and these is method

# In our rock paper scissors game it helps us to track how many times we loose, win or tie, i add also reset button
* We create the object outside the function to update it after every move not create new score every time
