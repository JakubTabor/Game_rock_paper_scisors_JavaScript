# Every HTML element has a method addEventListener(), it lets us run some code when we interact with the element, just like onclick
* It takes 2 parameters, first is the event and second is a function
* It let us add multiple event listeners for an event or remove event listeners

# We can also add keydown event, so when we press r it will choose rock as our move, and so on with p and s
* And i add event as a parameter of our function
* So once we type r, p, s, addEventListener will save the event object in the parameter and run the function 

# We are gonna add autoplay button and the moves will be every 1 second
* And i add also stop auto play button, we use fact that setInterval() return a number and we can use it to stop the interval
* To save previous id of the interval we save it inside a variable
* Then we use clearInterval function to stop the interval, i pass inside current id and we can set is autoplaying to false
