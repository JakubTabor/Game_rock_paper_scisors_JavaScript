# Every HTML element has a method addEventListener(), it lets us run some code when we interact with the element, just like onclick
* It takes 2 parameters, first is the event and second is a function
* It let us add multiple event listeners for an event or remove event listeners

# We can also add keydown event, so when we press r it will choose rock as our move, and so on with p and s
* And i add event as a parameter of our function
* So once we type r, p, s, addEventListener will save the event object in the parameter and run the function 

# We are gonna add autoplay button and the moves will be every 1 second
* And i add also stop auto play button, we use fact that setInterval() return a number and we can use it to stop the interval
* To save previous id of the interval we save it inside a variable
* Then we use clearInterval function to stop the interval, i pass inside current id and we can set is autoplaying to false

# Now to improve todoList project i move onclick attribute to JavaScript using eventListener
* To add eventListener to the delete button i need to move it to the page
* So i use querySelectorAll and all need to be, because we need to select all delete elements on the page
* And i loop through these list of delete buttons using forEach

# Another advanced array methods are filter() and map()
* For filter() we put inside function and 2 parameters: value and index
* function will take each value and save inside value in meantime running the function
* These inner function will return the value (boolean), like true
* filter function creates new array and if inner function returns true it will put the value in the new array

# Another feature is Closure, it means that the value is gets packaged together with the function
* So event if value index gets deleted after the loop, we can click delete button later and function have access to index

# We are gonna add autoplay button and the moves will be every 1 second
* And i add also stop auto play button, we use fact that setInterval() return a number and we can use it to stop the interval
* To save previous id of the interval we save it inside a variable
* Then we use clearInterval function to stop the interval, i pass inside current id and we can set is autoplaying to false

# I gonna use arrow function in the part where i pass a function into another function, in autoPlay
