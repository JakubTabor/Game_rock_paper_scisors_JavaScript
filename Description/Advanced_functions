# Every HTML element has a method addEventListener(), it lets us run some code when we interact with the element, just like onclick
* It takes 2 parameters, first is the event and second is a function
* It let us add multiple event listeners for an event or remove event listeners

# We can also add keydown event, so when we press r it will choose rock as our move, and so on with p and s
* And i add event as a parameter of our function
