# JSON is similar to JavaScript object syntax and it can be understood by other programing languages
* When we convert JavaScript object into JSON object using stringify it results in string, but it not support the functions
* To convert JSON to JavaScript we use JSON.parse() inside brackets JSON string

# Local storage save values more permamently
* Because variables are temporary, they exist on current page, if we refresh or close the page they are deleted

# We are gonna use these in our rock paper scissors game, it will save it in local storage
* So in the part, where we update the score in our project, we are gonna save it in local storage
* To store it, first we type localStorage object and to save a value inside we use method .setItem()
* And local storage only support strings, to get these string out of the local storage we use method getItem()
* When we load the page we are gonna get that value out of local storage

# Now i gonna use it to get score object, first convert it into string using JSON.stringify
* Next instead of resetting all scores to 0, we are gonna use score from local storage
* But first we need to convert it once again into an object using JSON.parse
* We also need to remove score from the local storage when we click reset button using method removeItem
 * But not the score doesnt exist in localStorage, so we get null, to fix these we are gonna set default value, which will be 0
