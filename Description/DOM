# To create document object model we type document.body.innerHTML and assign the value to it
* Document is a built in object, next we are accessing property of document object (body)
* And then we are accessing property of body object (innerHTML)
 When we change innerHTML property the web page changes, so the document object and the web page are linked together

# document.body, take the <body> element and put inside our JavaScript
* Dom combain html and javascript together and html element is converted into a javascript object
* innerHTML control all HTML inside the body

# The querySelector lets us get any element from the page and put inside our JavaScript
* Inside the brackets we specify, which element we want to get
* When html element is inside JavaScript is just JavaScript object and it has properties and methods, that we can use
